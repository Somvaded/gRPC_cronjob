To scale this service to handle 10000 concurrent requests per second, i think these ideas will help.

1. For Horizontal Scaling
-> Package the app using Docker and use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod AutoScaler to auto scale replicas on top of maybe Amazon EC2.
-> Use load-balancer

2. gRPC Load-Balancing
-> From client side we can use the build in load-balancer.
-> From server side we can use service like Envoy Proxy

3. Report Storage Persistence
-> We can use PostgreSQL for consistency or Cassandra DB for horizontal scalability.

4. Reliability
-> We can use patterns like circuit breakers to isolate faulty instances and retry logic with exponential backoffs.
